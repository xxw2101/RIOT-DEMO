for this week's assignment, i am still working on my understanding toward Riot 

3 ways that make element show/hide; “if/show/hide”:

```
<main>
    <h1 if={hideEl}>This is the Element to be hided</h1>
    <button onclick={change}>Click Me to Hide/Show the H1</button>

    <script>
        this.hideEl = False;
        this.change = function() {
            this.hideEl = !this.hideEl;
        }
    </script>
</main>
```


if we change the abovementioned if to hide or show, it will still proceed to function
