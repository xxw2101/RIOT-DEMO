# RIOT-DEMO

Hi there, for this week's assignment, i was not able to upload any video due to the series problem caused by vpn connections. i had problem accessing online videos as well, therefore, i kinda of yahooed some main features regarding the Riot. 

for Riot, there are two basic type: real time or the local; the real time requires riot.js plus the compiler file, link sthe riot with tag file. such as:<script type="tag/riot" src="tags/main.tag"></script>

for index file, the <script> part has to come with riot.amount ("*")for loading specific tag.
